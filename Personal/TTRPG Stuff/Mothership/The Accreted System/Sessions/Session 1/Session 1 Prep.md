## Scenario: Retrieve precious cargo/undertake a dangerous mission
## Setting: Aboard the [[Æ Starfall]]/Aboard Æthersystems Orbital Shipyard

### TOMBS: [[Infected AI Core]]
* Transgression: An artificial intelligence passing through sub-space via [[Wormhole Drive]]
* Omens: Starfall experiences system malfunctions once the probe has been retrieved
* Manifestation: Infected Shipyard AI/Androids
* Banishment: Ejecting the Shipyard Core mid-wormhole jump
* Slumber: Awakens if Transgression is repeated

### Notes
* Party is assembled by Æthersystems to retrieve an unmanned probe that was testing an experimental FTL drive known as the "Wormhole Drive"
* Party is given command of the Æ Starfall
	* Æ Starfall is secretly powered by the new Wormhole Drive tech and 2J# fuel (plus a bit extra to account for cargo weight)
* Party activates drive, collects the probe in their cargo bay, and returns to the Orbital Shipyard
* Credits are transferred to their account and congratulated on a job well done!
* Oh but their shuttle off station has been delayed due to intense solar storms and won't be arriving for another week or so
* Shipyard systems begin to go haywire the next day
	* systems go offline or are overpowered
	* Ship assembly robots short circuit and catch fire, destroying a dry dock and exposing it to open space
	* Finally Station Service Androids become hostile and speak as one known as "Core"
* The shipyard is also a secret biological science testing station that is working on boosting human intelligence to computer speeds
* Core wants to make it off station and infect more AI cores and spread as punishment for it's slumber being disturbed
* Crew needs to rid the station of Core before the station tears itself apart or the shuttle back to central space arrives
### Survive
* Psychological Trauma
* Social Pressures
* Violent Encounters
* Environmental Hazards
* Resource Scarcity
### Solve
* How to hack against the core to get the shipyard's technical schematic
	* Alarm
* How to get to the core, remove it, load it on to the Starfall and jump without tearing the station apart
	* Hazardous Path
	* Egg Carry
* How to calculate the final jump without computers (becoming basically a Guild Navigator)
### Save
* The Shipbuilders
* Station Lice
* The original AI Core
* Æthersystems Scientists
