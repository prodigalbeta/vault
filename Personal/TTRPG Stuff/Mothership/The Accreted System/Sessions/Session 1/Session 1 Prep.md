## Scenario: Retrieve precious cargo/undertake a dangerous mission
## Setting: Aboard the [[Æ Starfall]]/Aboard Æthersystems Orbital Shipyard

### TOMBS: [[Infected AI Core]]
* Transgression: An artificial intelligence passing through sub-space via Wormhole drive
* Omens: Starfall experiences system malfunctions once the probe has been retrieved
* Manifestation: Infected Shipyard AI/Androids
* Banishment: Ejecting the Shipyard Core mid-wormhole jump
* Slumber: Awakens if Transgression is repeated

### Notes
* Party is assembled by Æthersystems to retrieve an unmanned probe that was testing an experimental FTL drive known as the "Wormhole Drive"
* Party is given command of the Æ Starfall
	* Æ Starfall is secretly powered by the new Wormhole Drive tech
* Party activates drive, collects the probe in their cargo bay, and returns to the Orbital Shipyard
* Credits are transferred to their account and congratulated on a job well done!
* Oh but their shuttle off station has been delayed due to intense solar storms and won't be arriving for another week or so
* Shipyard systems begin to go haywire the next day
	* systems go offline or are overpowered
	* Ship assembly robots short circuit and catch fire
	* Finally Station Service Androids become hostile and speak as one known as "Core"
* Core wants to make it off station and infect more AI cores and spread as punishment for it's slumber being disturbed
* Crew needs to rid the station of Core before the station tears itself apart or the shuttle back to central space arrives
