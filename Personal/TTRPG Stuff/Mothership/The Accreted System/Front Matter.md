## The Terran Generational Fleet
  * Began as a generational fleet that left earth and set out at sub-light speeds
	    - Eventually more and more left earth once faster than light speed travel was discovered
	    - The fleet was largely forgotten for nearly 58 generations until the ghost ships appeared on the edge of a Galactic Border colony
		    - By that point they largely had become a folk tale/myth you told children that were getting to adventurous for their own good
#### The Fleet Admiralty
   * Traditional military command structure, modeled after US Naval command
#### Workers Guild
* setup as a general purpose union for ship laborers of all trades within the fleet, eventually became a mouthpiece for the Admiralty, dropping all pretenses of being a collective bargaining union

### Terran Peoples Army
   * Formed after the effective dissolution of the Workers Guild
   * Militaristic and actively revolting against the Admiralty and Guild
   * Operated out of a seized residential capsule hub ship 
	   * only group to make it out of the Fleet and assimilate into larger galactic culture
		   * They keep well enough hidden containing the secrets of what the Admiralty and Guild woke up on their journey
		   * Those that did make it out are essentially unwitting sleeper agents for the Mother of Machines
