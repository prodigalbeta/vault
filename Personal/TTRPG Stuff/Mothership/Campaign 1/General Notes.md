# Setting

    - The Terran Independent Mining Fleet has recently come into orbit around an historically large asteroid belt. 
    - Estimates say that the Fleet will never be able to completely mine this belt dry if they're able to hold on to the system.
    - The entire system stays in a geostationary orbit around a micro black hole
        - Fleet scientists determined full asteroid harvesting as they once did is not viable in this system due to the delicate gravitational forces around the micro black hole

# Factions

## Within the Fleet

### The Terran Independent Mining Fleet
    - Began as a generational fleet that left earth and set out at less than light speed
    - Eventually more and more left earth once faster than light speed travel was discovered
    - The fleet was largely forgotten for nearly 58 generations until they appeared on the edge of a Galactic Border colony
        - By that point they largely had become a folk tale/myth you told children that were getting to adventurous for their own good
    - The fleet was retrofitted with FTL drives but declined an officiall settlement as they had become used to living shipside
    - Due to the unique differences in technology and relatively close proximity to original earth culture, they were granted  "independent galactic citizenship" which granted them full rights as Galactic citizens but allowed them to establish their own code of laws to be administered in the fleet alone.
    - The fleet continued to roam the galaxy, mining asteroids for trade for several generations before coming to stop at the acretion system
#### The Fleet Admiralty
    - Tradiditional military command structure, modeled after US Naval command
#### Miners Guild
    - 

### Belter Peoples Army

    - Formed in the few years after arriving at the Acrection System, realizing the extent of manual labor involved with the traditional mining technique.
    - Began as a labor union, became radically militaristic after brutal union busting tactics by both the Admiralty and the Guild resulting the death of nearly a thousand miners
    - Operates out of a seized residential capsule hub ship
